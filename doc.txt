The hardware of a computer system includes all the physical components. The central processing unit (CPU) is the electronic circuitry that executes instructions comprising a computer program. The CPU performs basic arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input/output (I/O) operations specified by the instructions in the program. Random-access memory (RAM) is a form of computer memory that can be read and changed in any order, typically used to store working data and machine code. A graphics processing unit (GPU) is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the creation of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display device.
